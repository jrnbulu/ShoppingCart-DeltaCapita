Hi Jyoti,

I've have reviewed your application for our Java Developer - AVP/VP and I am very impressed with your experience.

I can confirm you have passed the CV screening round and we would now like you to complete a technical assessment.

Please could review and complete the shopping test attached? If I could have your completed test back as soon as possible that would be appreciated.

Guidance:
• Please complete the test in Java
• Please include best practices being implemented: Unit Tests, project layout...
• If you could send it completed via GIT or similar.
• You should only need to spend a couple of hours on the test

Using Java, write a simple program that calculates the price of a basket of shopping.

The solution should be accomplished in roughly two hours.

Items are presented one at a time, in a list, identified by name - for example "Apple" or "Banana".

Multiple items are present multiple times in the list, so for example ["Apple", "Apple", "Banana"] is a basket
with two apples and one banana.

Items are priced as follows:

 - Apples are 35p each
 - Bananas are 20p each
 - Melons are 50p each, but are available as ‘buy one get one free’
 - Limes are 15p each, but are available in a ‘three for the price of two’ offer

Given a list of shopping, calculate the total cost of those items.
